# BazzellCLI

![bazzellcli example](https://github.com/dmw94/bazzellcli/blob/main/example.png)

BazzellCLI brings [IntelTechniques Search Tools](https://inteltechniques.com/tools) to the command line.

Michael Bazzell's useful suite of OSINT tools are a great start for any investigation; however, I wanted to access these via the terminal rather than through a webpage. I've uploaded this repo so that you can too.

If you like this application, feel free to buy me a coffee!
